# Family Meal

## Overview
Family meal is a sight designed to help solve the problems of restaurant food waste and personal food insecurity. This is the first draft of this sight and really only implements core functionality arount a location based feed and multi user type interface. The idea is restaurants will be able to post excess food they have for partner distributors or individuals to 'pickup' and community members will be able to view these posts and rsvp for pickups. The idea is to simplify the donating process for restaraunts as well as provide additional incentives like donation value tracking for tax deductions and PR. 


#### Technologies Used
> This project used node.js, mongoDB, express, React, Tailwind and css technologies.
>
> APIs used: Google Distance Matrix API

This is the search page where a user can search for another user and any matching results will be shown. When clicked, the result will take the user to the searched profile page. 


## Getting Started
To view the site go here. 

Some notes:
- Create an account and choose the restaurant option for profile settup (community member not yet working)
- To see dummy posts and restaurants make your address somewhere in Boulder, CO or San Francisco, CA


## What's next?
Too many features to list but build out full functionality to what I imagine would make restaurant donating easier and creates more and easier access to people in need.
